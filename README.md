# Drivers_API_C_CPP_Migration
Intent of this repository is to share the strategies used to convert Tool generated C code into C++ without doing modifications in existing software.

It contains strategies to convert current tool generated C software drivers into C++ drivers with API.

I have taken reference from Infineon DAVE generated software and modified it according to me and then converted it into C++.

Optimization techniques needs to be considered while converting code, otherwise code size and code processing might become a major task to be dealt with!
